# Basic React Native App - built with Expo environment
Before CRUDding on this app, the first goal is to learn the default structure as well as some of the components.

### Planning Strategy
In the first 2 days of this project I used a combonation of LinkedIn Learning and reading the React Native docs to set up a development environment and debug some issues with this process.

Next I plan on studying components availible in React Native and practicing building a front end out with modern features.
